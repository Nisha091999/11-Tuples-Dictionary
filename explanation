def calculate_bmi(weight, height):

This line defines a function named calculate_bmi that takes two parameters: weight and height.
The function calculates the BMI by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters.
It returns the calculated BMI value.
def sort_list(lst):

This line defines another function called sort_list that takes a single parameter, lst, which is a list of individuals' data.
The function sorts the list based on multiple criteria, including BMI, age, name, and gender.
It uses the sorted() function and a lambda function as the key parameter to determine the sorting order.
The lambda function specifies the order of sorting based on the values in the list: x[4] (gender), x[0] (name), x[1] (age), 
and calculate_bmi(x[2], x[3]) (BMI calculated using the weight and height values).
input_list = []

This line initializes an empty list called input_list, which will store the input data of individuals.
while True:

This line starts an infinite loop to continuously receive user input until the user decides to stop.
input_str = input("Enter name, age, weight, height, gender (or press Enter to stop): ")

This line prompts the user to enter data for an individual in the specified format: name, age, weight, height, and gender.
The user can press Enter without entering any value to stop the input process.
if not input_str:

This line checks if the input_str variable is empty, indicating that the user pressed Enter without entering any value.
If the condition is true, it breaks out of the loop, terminating the input process.
name, age, weight, height, gender = input_str.split(",")

This line splits the input_str into separate values using the comma as the delimiter.
It assigns the split values to individual variables: name, age, weight, height, and gender.
age = int(age)

This line converts the age variable from a string to an integer using the int() function.
It ensures that the age value is represented as an integer data type.
weight = int(weight)

This line converts the weight variable from a string to an integer.
It ensures that the weight value is represented as an integer data type.
height = int(height)

This line converts the height variable from a string to an integer.
It ensures that the height value is represented as an integer data type.
input_list.append((name, age, weight, height, gender))

This line creates a tuple containing the individual's data and appends it to the input_list.
The tuple consists of name, age, weight, height, and gender values.
sorted_list = sort_list(input_list)

This line calls the sort_list function and passes the input_list as the argument.
It assigns the sorted result to the sorted_list variable.
for item in sorted_list:

This line starts a loop that iterates over each item in the sorted_list.
print(",".join(str(x) for x in item))

This line converts each element in the item tuple to a string using a generator expression: str(x) for x in item.
It joins the string elements with commas using the ",".join() function.
The resulting string is then printed to the console.
